# Rust notes
This is a basic repo with some rust notes and codes. Just for fun and learning.

## Basic

### Create a new project
```bash
cargo new hello_world
```
This will create a new folder, with a file called `Cargo.toml` which contains the metadata of the project and used dependencies. Also a `src` folder with the source code of the project.

### Compile and run a project

```bash
cargo run
```
